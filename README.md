# Fashion-MNIST Neural Network (NumPy)

This project implements a feedforward neural network and backpropagation
from scratch using NumPy. No automatic differentiation frameworks are used.

## Features
- Custom forward and backward propagation
- Optimizers: SGD, Momentum, Nesterov, RMSProp, Adam
- Training and validation on Fashion-MNIST
- Accuracy and loss evaluation

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## To run baisc experment
``` pip python main.py
